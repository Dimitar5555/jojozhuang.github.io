> CloudFormation and Beanstalk.

## 1. CloudFormation
### 1.1 What is CloudFormation?
AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to model and provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment. AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third party resources.

### 1.2 Summary
* CloudFormation is a way of completely scripting your cloud environment.
* Quick Start is a bunch of CloudFormation templates already built by AWS Solutions Architects allowing you to create complex environments very quickly.

## 2. Lab - CloudFormation
### 2.1 Create Cloudformation

## 3. Elastic Beanstalk
### 3.1 What is Beanstalk?
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.

### 3.2 Summary
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

## 4. Lab - Elastic Beanstalk
### 4.1 Create Elastic Beanstalk
