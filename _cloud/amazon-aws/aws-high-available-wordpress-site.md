## 6. Lab - Wordpress Site
### 6.1 HA Word Press Site
The architecture of the wordpress website.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-1.png)
1) Create two S3 buckets, one for storing codes, another for media files.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-2.png)
2) Create distribution: Services->Networking & Content Delivery->CloudFront, Create Distribution.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-3.png)
Choose the **media** bucket for the Origin Domain Name, leave others as default.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-4.png)
The distribution is created and it takes some time to be ready.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-5.png)
3) Security Group  
Make sure the WebDMZ group has port 80 opened for all incoming requests.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-6.png)
And make sure rds group has opened mysql database port to WebDMZ group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-7.png)
4) Create MySQL database, Services->RDS->Create Database, choose 'Dev/Test'.  
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-8.png)
Specify db identifier, db name and password.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-9.png)
Select 't2.micro' for DB instance class, set storage size to 1000GB.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-10.png)
Enable Multi-AZ.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-11.png)
Expand 'Additional connectivity configuration', choose the 'rds-launch-wizard' as the security group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-12.png)
Specify the initial database name, so that a new database will be created once the rds instance is launched.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-13.png)
MySQL instance is created.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-14.png)
5) Create new Role, Services->IAM->Roles->Create Role, choose EC2.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-15.png)
Search 's3', choose 'AmazonS3FullAccess'.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-16.png)
Skip the tag, provide the name for the new role.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-17.png)
6) Create EC2 instance.  
In 'Configure Instance' step, leave others unchanged, just change the role with the one we just created, S3ForWP. And paste the bootstrap script to user data.
```raw
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd php php-mysql -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "healthy" > healthy.html
wget https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
rm -rf wordpress
rm -rf wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 wp-content
chown -R apache:apache wp-content
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketforwordpresslab-donotdelete/htaccess.txt
mv htaccess.txt .htaccess
chkconfig httpd on
service httpd start
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-18.png)
Set Tag.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-19.png)
Select the WebDMZ security group, launch instance.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-20.png)
Lab problem.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-6-wordpress-lab-problem.png)
### 6.2 Setting Up EC2
1) Preparation:  
Check that FrontCloud Distribution created in previous lab is enabled and deployed.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-1.png)
The RDS(MySQL) is also available.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-2.png)
EC2 Instance is up now, copy the public ip address.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-3.png)
ssh to the web server instance, navigate to /var/www/html directory, check if all wp files are there.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-4.png)
Also check if htaccess is configured.
```raw
cat .htaccess
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-5.png)
2) Launch WordPress and create a new post with images.  
Start the apache server and visit the ip address in web browser, wordpress is started.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-6.png)
Setup wordpress, the database host is the endpoint of the MySQL instance.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-7.png)
Error occurs: canâ€™t write the wp-config.php file.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-8.png)
Copy the script, then ssh to the web server. Create a file named wp-config.php in folder /var/www/html with the script. Refresh the page, you should see the wordpress configuration page successfully. Put the required information here, click "Install WordPress".
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-9.png)
WordPress is installed successfully.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-10.png)
Login with acloudgur/acloudguru.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-11.png)
Home page of WordPress.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-12.png)
Create a new post with two images.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-13.png)
Click publish, new the post is published and we are able to view it.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-14.png)
In the web server, we will see the upload folder with two image files.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-15.png)
3) Next, we want each time user uploads the images, they can be replicated to S3 automatically.

Use `aws s3 ls` to show the existing buckets in s3. Use `aws s3 cp` command to copy files from web server to s3 **media** buckets.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-16.png)
Moreover, use `aws s3 cp` to copy the entire wordpress files into s3 **code** bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-17.png)
Use `aws s3 ls` to check all files are copied to s3 bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-18.png)
4) Setup redirect, whenever user accesses the post, all the image requests will be redirected to s3.  
Get the domain name of the cloudfront distribution.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-19.png)
Edit the '.htaccess' file.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-20.png)
Update the `rewriterrule` with the domain name of cloudfront distribution, which is pointing to s3.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-21.png)
Use `aws s3 sync` to sync the changed files from web server to s3 buckets. This time, only the '.htaccess' file is synced.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-22.png)
Edit file `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-23.png)
Change the value of `AllowOverride` from None to All.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-24.png)
Run `service httpd restart` to restart apache.
5) Update bucket policy for **media** bucket.  
Paste the following script into Bucket Policy, replace the arn.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
        ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
        ]
    }
  ]
}
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-25.png)
After clicking "Save" button, both permission and bucket policy are marked as public.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-26.png)
If you encounter any error, select the s3 bucket, click "Edit public access settings".
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-27.png)
Make sure none of the options are checked, and save.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-28.png)
Wait for a while, revisit the post, the image should be fetched from the cloudfront, which is pointing to s3 media bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-29.png)
5) Create new application load balancer.  
Put the name.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-30.png)
Select all available AZs.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-31.png)
Select the WebDMZ security group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-32.png)
Create a new target group, set path to healthy.html.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-33.png)
Choose the instance, then create.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-34.png)
Load balancer is created, wait for few minutes, the status is changed to 'active'.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-35.png)
6) Optional step, domain name, Services->Route 53->Hosted Zone.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-36.png)
Select the existing domain, click 'Create Record Sets'.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-37.png)
Choose 'Alias'=Yes, Alias Target = application load balancer.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-38.png)
Now the dns is pointing to the load balancer.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-39.png)
7) Target Group. Add instance into target group.

Services->EC2->Target Group, select the target group, click Edit button in Targets tab.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-40.png)
Select the instance and click 'Add to registered'.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-41.png)
Wait for a while, the status becomes healthy.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-42.png)
Visit the domain, we should see the post.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-7-wordpress-43.png)
### 6.3 Adding Resilience And Autoscaling
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-resilience-autoscaling-1.png)
Lab: The left node will be used for writing only and all the read request will be sent to the right node, which is a replica of the left.

1) Automate files synchronization from web server to s3 bucket.  
Create file named `crontab` in `/etc` directory.
```raw
cd /etc
nano crontab
```
Put the following content into it. The sync happens in every minute.
```raw
*/1 * * * * root aws s3 sync --delete s3://acloudguruwp-code-rjk19 /var/www/html
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-resilience-autoscaling-2.png)

Run following command to start the `cront` service.
```raw
service cront restart
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-resilience-autoscaling-3.png)
Test this by uploading a file into the **code** bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-resilience-autoscaling-4.png)
Restart the cront service, find the file in /etc/www/html directory.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-resilience-autoscaling-5.png)
2) Setup the read replica and put it behind the load balancer.  
Select the WordPress EC2 instance, Actions->Image->Create Image.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-1.png)
Set the name and description, create image.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-2.png)
The EC2 instance will reboot and an AMI is create.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-3.png)

3) Update crontab configuration in the first WP instance, which will be used as write node.
```raw
*/1 * * * * root aws s3 sync --delete /var/www/html s3://acloudguruwp-code-rjk19
*/1 * * * * root aws s3 sync --delete /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads/ s3://acloudguruwp-media-rjk19
```
* Be aware of that this web server a writing node.
* The first rule: sync all files from write instance to **code** bucket.
* The second rule: sync all uploaded images from write instance to **media** bucket.

![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-4.png)
Testing the settings. Create a file named test.txt in the /var/www/html directory and restart the cront service.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-5.png)
Go to the s3 **code** bucket, test.txt is there. You may not be able to see it immediately due to the eventual consistency.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-6.png)
4) Launch new instance for read node.  
Create auto scaling group, Services->EC2->Auto Scaling Group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-1.png)
Select the option 'Create a new launch configuration'.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-2.png)
Select the own AMI image.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-3.png)

Set name, choose IAM role and put the bootstrap script into user data.
```raw
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
aws s3 sync --delete s3://YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME /var/www/html
```
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-4.png)
Keep the default values for storage.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-5.png)
Select the WebDMZ security group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-6.png)
After clicking the launch instance, you will see the 'configure autoscaling group' page. Set name, select all available AZs.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-7.png)
Choose the Target Group and set the grace period to 60 seconds, next.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-8.png)
Leave as it is.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-9.png)
Skip the notification, set instance tag.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-10.png)
Review, create auto scaling group.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-11.png)
5) Remove the write node from the target group. Select the target group, click edit button.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-12.png)
Select the instance, click remove button.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-13.png)
Now we see the two read nodes.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-14.png)
Rename the write node to MyWP-WN to make more clear.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-15.png)
Check the target group, both two read nodes are healthy.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-launch-read-replica-16.png)
6) Testing  
Visit the site with the domain name, it should return the images from s3 bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-1.png)
Visit the admin page of wordpress, http://domain/wp-admin/, input user name and password.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-2.png)
Now we are in the admin page. Notice that the domain is an ip address, which is write's node public ip.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-3.png)
Create a new post with uploading a picture.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-4.png)
The image is not showing properly. This is because the image is not propagated from s3 bucket yet.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-5.png)
Publish the post and wait for few minutes. Refresh the page, we should be able to see the image.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-6.png)
If we visit the frontend, we should see the new post with image propagated properly.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-7.png)
If we copy the image url and view it in browser, we should see it is from the cloudfront, from s3 bucket.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-read-replica-testing-8.png)
7) Test High Availability.  
Terminate one of the read node.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-1.png)
Check the target group, there is only one healthy instance. If we visit the site, it is still responsive, though there may be some latency.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-2.png)
Check the auto scaling group, check the history, it detects the unhealthy occurrence.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-3.png)
New instance will be launched automatically.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-4.png)
Check the target group, wait until the healthy node comes back. Again, we have to healthy read nodes.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-5.png)
Refresh the site, it is still running properly. We have auto healing system!
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-8-testing-availability-6.png)

### 6.4 Cleaning Up
Lab: RDS failover, High availability of database.  

Reboot the database.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-1.png)
Select the "Reboot With Failover" option. The database will be failed over from one availability zone to another.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-2.png)
The database will be rebooted.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-3.png)
The website will not be accessible, 504 error is returned.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-4.png)
Once the database comes back, our site will work again.
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-5.png)
![image](/assets/images/cloud/4112/8-9-rds-failover-6.png)
Delete all assets, instance, database, buckets, etc for clean up.
